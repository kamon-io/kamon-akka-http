kamon.akka-http {

  # Fully qualified name of the implementation of kamon.akka.http.AkkaHttp.OperationNameGenerator that will be used for
  # assigning operation names to Server and Client operations generated by the Akka HTTP Instrumentation. If the value
  # is "default" a simple generator with the following rules will be used:
  #   - Client operations will be named after the Host they are targetting.
  #   - Server operations will be named after the Path in the request.
  #
  # Note: It is highly recommended to use the `operationName` directive or supply your own name generator to avoid
  # cardinality explosion caused by variable sections in the Path.

  # Add http status codes as metric tags. The default value is false
